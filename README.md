# CanvasReminder
This program takes in an authorized access token for Canvas LMS. It then goes and grabs the students classes and assignments due after the date and time the program was run. It also asks if they would like a text message reminder. If they do they input their gmail login information and phone number as the program uses the gmail smtp client to send a text message to the phone number.

Currently being used to create a Web API to be used in a web application and mobile application.
